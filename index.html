            aj Mahal, located in Agra in the state of Uttar Pradesh, is widely
            considered as a symbol of eternal love. It is a monument built in
            the 17th Century. It was built during the Mughal rule, and can be
            summed up as a brilliant representation of grandeur that Mughal
            architecture stood for. Built under the reign of Shah Jahan, the
            Mughal emperor, Taj Mahal is actually a mausoleum of his beloved and
            consort Mumtaj Mahal. Its ethereal beauty typically signifies the
            beauty of his beloved, in whose memory this architectural genius was
            created. Taj Mahal is also one of the Seven Wonders of the world,
            popularly known for its white marble construction and surrounding
            greenscape. It also earns a place among UNESCO's
            World Heritage Sites.

            A significant landmark in Delhi, the Red Fort or Lal Qila is a
            splendid monument from the Mughal period. It serves as a testament
            to the country's rich cultural heritage and architectural finesse.
            The striking red sandstone walls coupled with delicate carvings make
            for a breathtaking sight. The fort houses several significant
            structures that are worth exploring. The Diwan-i-Aam, or the Hall of
            Public Audience, is a vast courtyard where the emperor addressed the
            general public. The Diwan-i-Khas, or the Hall of Private Audience,
            is known for its stunning marble throne where the emperor held
            private meetings. The Rang Mahal, or the Palace of Colours, was the
            residence of the royal ladies and features beautiful
            decorative motifs.

          The Golden Temple or Sri Harmandir Sahib, one of India's most
          significant religious landmarks, is located along Punjab's Amritsar
          area amongst other sacred sites. Guru Ram Das, who happened to be the
          fourth Sikh Guru, initiated this Gurudwara’s construction during the
          16th century with Hazrat Mian Mir, a respected Muslim saint, laying
          down its foundation stone as a symbol of inclusivity and unity. Guru
          Arjan Dev who followed through to completion at 1604 A.D, further went
          on to make extensive renovations and expansions over time, thus
          maintaining its significance.
